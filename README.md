# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Your Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am&ndash;5pm) by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.

## Workday Scheduler

When the user visits this page, they are presented with hourly time blocks that corrospond with the average work day. The current date is displayed in the header on the page.
The colors of the time blocks update in real time, using a simple color key or grey for past, red for present and green for future time blocks.
When the user wants to add an event or meeting, they simply type it in the time block and click the save button. 
This app used jquery to ensure the js isn't executed until the entirety of the html is loaded and with the addition of local storage the events will remain despite the page being reloaded!
